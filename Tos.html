        <label>PAYMENT</label>
        <p>
            Payments will always be 100% in advance, before starting the work of the sketch, by Paypal without shipping address, to avoid withheld payments, or Paypal invoice You must send me a screenshot in the conversation where it is reflected that you have sent me the money.
If you requested a slot and after a day has elapsed you don't make the corresponding payment, that slot will be "opened" again to someone else.
I don't currently accept payments by Ko-fi, or any other network, if you have doubts if I accept another method, you should ask me by direct message (dm).
no returns for any reason.

        <p>
            Then the corresponding payment will be made, you must tell me a little about what you want in your drawing, even if it is creative freedom, you should send me a message that says the personality, characteristics of the oc to give me an idea, I'll show you a simple messy sketch and from there I will start the idea of your commission, when the idea is approved it will begin progressively.
            You will always be sent screenshots showing you the progress of the drawing, which you will need to approve in order to proceed with the commission, if you approved a sketch and already clean and I was going to start coloring, you can't in this case or in another one change the entire Drawing, you have to pay extra min. $15 for each extra detail, Each extra character will be 100% more and if you want to change the complete drawing you will have to pay 50%of the total price more, the only exception to change something in the drawing must be partial and that I have overlooked them. Examples:
            - The shape of the hair.
            - The color of the glasses and eyes.
            - Freckles or moles.
            - The shape of their figure.
            - My mistakes.
            Depending on the difficulty of the background or details, the final price will increase, it may vary.

    <section class="deliver">
        <label>DELIVERY TIME</label>
        <p>
            Always tell me your deadline first, in case you don't have it you will be on a waiting list, where you will be assigned a number in order of arrival and difficulty of the commission.
            You can ask for your commission after 1 to 2 weeks, I keep a busy schedule and I'm not always finishing commissions, since I have a life apart from being an artist, What is totally fine is if you have doubts, clarify them calmly for me, I will always be aware of responding as quickly as possible.

    <section class="references">
        <label>REFERENCES</label>
        <p>
            Reference images are very helpful in completing a commission successfully, and faster.
            That is why it is good that the minimum you send as Reference is 5 images that are:
            - A full body image of the character (if it is the Reference sheet that shows several angles much better).
            - The Facial expression (angry, dummy, sleepy... there can be many ways to express a feeling).
            - The Pose ( If their are standing, sitting, lying down, fighting...).
            - The Clothes (a headband, earrings, gloves, skirt...).
            - The Color Palette.
